# API-to-Create-an-Employee-Directory

Using an API allowed me to Make a complete webpage based on information that was not had before the page's loading. The data on the page is completely original to that single request and if to reload the page you would get a new page with brand new data on it. 

During this project, I learned how to deal with abstract data as it's extremely important for a software developer to be able to do this.
